The goal of this branch is to train with known motifs and see if performance can be boosted.

To do this, we'll train the following TFs without GM12878 involved cell line (in both training and validation), and only
 along with seed=1 model versions.

REST
JUND
CTCF

The performance benchmark will be comparing original models trained under these settings and the new models with known
motifs.
